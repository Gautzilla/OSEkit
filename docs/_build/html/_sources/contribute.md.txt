### Development version


1. First, create an empty git repository in a newly created folder and clone this repository.

```bash
git init

git clone https://github.com/Project-OSmOSE/osmose-toolkit.git
```

2. Create a Conda virtual environment in python 3.10.

```bash
conda create --name osmose python=3.10 -y
conda activate osmose
```

3. Install poetry and use it to install the package.

```bash
conda install poetry
poetry install
```

Note: if `poetry install` fails with the message ``ImportError: cannot import name 'PyProjectException'``, run this line instead:

```bash
conda install -c conda-forge poetry==1.3.2
```

The package is installed in editable mode! You can now call it just like any regular python package as long as you are in the environment.

```python
import OSmOSE as osm

dataset = osm.Dataset()
```

Note that it is installed in editable mode, meaning that any change made to the package's file will be reflected immediately on the environment, without needing to reload it. 








## General workflow


1. Install locally our toolkit (see section **Local installation** below);

2. Start by reviewing our Github [issues](https://github.com/Project-OSmOSE/osmose-toolkit/issues), get in touch with our developer team to obtain an account, and propose new issues anytime following standard procedures (in particular, among other must-have: short description, assignees, status, label...);

3. Develop and validate locally your contribution. Please follow standad github procedures such as developing on a new branch built from our main branch; no pushes will be accepted on our main repository. We recomend the use of our poetry-based editable conda environment to ensure ??;

4. If intended to be deployed on Datarmor, please see section **Contribution on Datarmor** below;

5. Once validated, commit and push your branch to our Github project and create a pull-request so it can be properly peer-reviewed. 
 




## Validation of the cluster-based production version 

To develop and/or test your code contributions on Datarmor, use the local git repository located at `/home/datawork-osmose/osmose_toolkit_dev/`; the corresponding editable conda environment is named `osmose_dev`. To update yourself this local repository, you can use the following `osmose_activate` alias:

```csh
echo "alias osmose_activate='cd /home/datawork-osmose/osmose_package; git checkout main; git pull origin main; . /appli/anaconda/latest/etc/profile.d/conda.sh; conda activate /home/datawork-osmose/conda-env/osmose_dev/; cd -'" >> .bashrc
```

After reloading your shell, from now on typing 
```bash
bash
osmose_activate
``` 
will:

- Update the local package to the latest version.

- Activate the conda environment.

- Update or install any dependency that is not present.
