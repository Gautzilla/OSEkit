# Getting started 

Below you will find installation and how-to procedures to start **using** our toolkit both locally and in a cluster. 
 

## Installation

Our tooklit

People only interested in the stable versions of our toolkit, which are released on a regular basis and are available [here](https://github.com/Project-OSmOSE/osmose-toolkit/releases/tag/v0.1.0). You can then install it through `pip` and `whl` file as follows:


```bash
pip force-reinstall=True install osmose.whl
```



```{warning}
We discourage users to install the toolkit from our git repository, as it is under permanent development and thus potentially unstable and unfinished.
```

```{note}
If for any reason you get an unexpected error message or an incorrect result, please open a new issue in the [issue tracker](https://github.com/Project-OSmOSE/osmose-toolkit/issues) and we will try to answer promptly.
